## Why OpenVoiceOS?

OpenVoiceOS exists to make voice technology:

- **Open** – fully open-source, transparent, and hackable
- **Modular** – use everything, or only what you need
- **Privacy-first** – local by default, cloud optional
- **Vendor-agnostic** – works with multiple engines and backends
- **Deployable anywhere** – embedded devices, desktops, servers

Whether you’re building a product, a research platform, or your own assistant, OpenVoiceOS gives you the foundation.

## Not a Monolith. An Ecosystem.

OpenVoiceOS is not one giant application.

It’s an ecosystem of interoperable components, including:

- Core services & message bus
- Wake word engines
- Speech-to-Text (STT)
- Text-to-Speech (TTS)
- Skill framework
- Audio and hardware abstraction
- Optional GUI layers

You can mix, match, replace, or extend any part.

## What’s Next?

- 🚀 **Installation guides** live in `INSTALL.md`
- 📦 **Release information** is coordinated here
- 🔖 **Named releases** are coming soon
